Running project locally:
db loader script is blend.sql.There needs to be a user with a specific username and password that has certain privileges. These are:
user: 'blend_user',
password: 'blend_password'
This user must be able to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.

After this user is setup, the correct node modules have to be installed using npm install.

The app can then be run locally via node server.js. It can then be accessed in a browser using https://localhost:8080/

There is an online version of the app. It can be reached at https://blendproject.herokuapp.com/.
